Tensorflow installation in Mac M1 (from source):

1) open Terminal Get Info and enable "Open using Rosetta" (duplicate Terminal app for this and open Rosetta terminal)
2) git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
3) cd tensorflow
4) git checkout branch_name (for us: v2.4.1)
5) ./configure (say N to everything, leave default config)
6) bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package (takes approximately ~5 hours)
7) rename .whl file to disable OS restrictions (us: tensorflow-2.4.1-py3-none-any.whl)
8) pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-2.4.1-py3-none-any.whl (enable --force-reinstall if TF already installed)

And you are done! Try to run a few code snippets to see if your TF setup is working.

If you have python 3.8.5, you can skip steps 2-7 and run step 8 with the .whl file here (for TF 2.4.1).

The following .whl files work for python 3.7 and TF 1.15.0, 2.4.1, and 2.5.0:
